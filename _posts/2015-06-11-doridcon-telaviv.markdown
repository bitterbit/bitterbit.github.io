This is the second year Droidcon has taken place in Israel, this year I had gotten the opportunity to take part in this cool event. Two things that interested me the most were hearing interesting stories and tips and learning about new awesome tools.

## Interesting stories and tips
One of the biggest trends in this Droidcon was automation and testing. I think the Android developers realised that even with basically an unlimited number of different devices, there are ways to promise your product is on par with a certain standard. When compared to the web, there is still plenty of space to grow, but it seems as if we are on the right path. As Yossi Elkrief said in his session
> "If you want to move fast, you need good breaks"

As i see it, testing and automation are the breaks that will allow you to achieve the rapid development everyone are after.

### Interesting facts
* **Michael Vakulenko** said that when he worked at Qualcom, transitioning from development to testing was considered an upgrade
* **Gett** (formerly known as get taxi) gets 30 percent of its ideas from the developers themselves
