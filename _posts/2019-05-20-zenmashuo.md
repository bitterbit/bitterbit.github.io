## What's it called?!
In china, everything has it's own name, it dosent matter if its a brand or even a name...
For example _McDonald's_ is _màidāngláo_ (麦当劳) and _Donald Trump_ is _tèlǎngpǔ_ (特朗普).

When I just got here I wanted an app to translate between the english and chinese names but could'nt find any so I had forgot about it an continued with my life. Last week I had the idea of using Wikipedia to translate between chinese/english names, its no perfect but it is clean and easy (much esier that actually translating or holding a big dictionary).
That was when [https://zenmeshuo.surge.sh/](https://zenmeshuo.surge.sh/) was born, Go Check It Out!
