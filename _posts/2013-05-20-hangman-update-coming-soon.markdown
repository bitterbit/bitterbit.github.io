A new update to hangman to arrive soon

I am working on a big update for the Hangman app. I am planning to integrate Google Play Game Services into the game to allow score boards and achievements. These feature's are in development now and hopefully you will be able to put your hands on a copy in the next weeks. I am planning to add support for different UI languages.

Another new feature is support for long words, Hopefully you wont notice the difference but in the future new long words will be added.
