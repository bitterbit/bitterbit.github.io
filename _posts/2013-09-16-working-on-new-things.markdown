The last month was special for me, I got to focus on doing the things I enjoy most. I didn't need to worry about doing homework or getting a good grade, I took the opportunity and each day I did only what I really wanted to. I went to an Avicii show :O :P had fun with friends and worked only on projects I felt like working on.

One fun thing I worked on was a new design for my website, I made it only for fun and learned a lot about design in the process. hopefully i will manage to finalize and deploy it on my awesome website. another cool project I'm working on is an android game which I will dedicate my next post to. Unfortunately I managed to brake my amazing phone, it is still working but it kind of hurts to use him.
