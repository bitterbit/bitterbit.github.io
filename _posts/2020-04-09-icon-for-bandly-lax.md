title: "Icon for brandly/Lax"
---
An icon I designed was accepted and is now used in the opensource project [brandly/Lax](https://github.com/brandly/Lax)!
It took some time but now it's in :) 

Lax is an IRC client built with Electron & React.


### The New Icon 
I combined a standard "chat" icon with the electrons illustration emphasising on the electron backend. The light blue color is a continuation of the blue shades in the app.
